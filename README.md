# App_Icons_Black_Theme

In this repository are icons for applications on your PC. Fell free to download and use them.

## Getting started
To use those Icons, you right-click the icon you want to change and then on `Settings`. Then you click on `Change Icon` and search for the downloaded Icon. After that, you just have to apply it.

If you think I forgot some Icons for files, feel free to write a comment.
