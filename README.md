# App_Icons_Black_Theme

# Introduction
I created Icons for applications on your PC. Fell free to download and use them.

But please donÂ´t say that they are yours!

# Getting started
To use those Icons you make a right click and then on `Settings`. Then you click on `Change Icon` and search for the downloaded Icon. After that you just have to apply it.

If you think that I forgot some Icons for files, feel free to write a comment.
